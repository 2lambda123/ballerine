### What you can find here?
*  Front-end SDK for flows KYC/KYB
*   Integrations to multiple identity verification vendors
*   Case management to manually approve customers
*   Analytics to optimize performance and conversion rate

### Why Open Source KYC?
*   Future proof - modular and extendable building blocks
*   Global - Multiple vendors are accessible in one UI
*   White label - Customizable UX and UI


## Demo
Open and Composable Identity building blocks that integrate with any KYC vendor. 
Any component is modular and can be used independently (they do play very nice altogether though ðŸ™‚).

### Modular UI
Ballerine provides you with a native SDK/web flow you can tweak for your needs.
You can add steps and functionalities, change the UI, and more, all by changing parameters in JSON files.
Build/get KYC and KYB flows, tweak the UI to be on-brand, collect documents and user inputs.

### Case management

Use Ballerine case management dashboard to approve, reject or classify users manually.
You create workflows your operators can trigger from the interface, change the interface layout and add data you want present in order to optimize your dashboard to your way of working.

### Architecture
**Components**
Components are primitives which perform a single function.
 - What you can do with components:
	 - Contribute your own components to the system.
	 - Use components others have made

 **Apps** 
 Apps are made out of a set of components composed together to perform a workflow.
   -   What you can do with apps:
        -   Compose apps using various types of components
        -   Contribute apps you have made
        -   Use existing apps others made.

  **Building blocks**
Ballerineâ€™s building blocks are the infrastructure that knows how to work with apps and components, connect and run them as you please.
