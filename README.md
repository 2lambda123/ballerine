### High-Level Architecture

Ballerine's architecture is flexible and composable.

**Components**

Components are independent and reusable frontend or backend pieces of configuration, code, or connectors.
Each component can be plugged into the infrastructure and used by the underlying building blocks.

**Apps** 

Apps bundle are a set of components and connectors that serve a specific use case (like KYC/KYB).
	
**Connectors** 

Connectors are integrations to 3rd party vendors. They can be generated with an OpenAPI spec automatically or be built following a predefined interface.
