# Ballerine is an Open-source Infrastructure for User Identity and Risk Management

<h5>This project's mission is to help any company verify its customersâ€™ identity while providing an amazing user experience.</h5>
</div>


## Description
Ballerine is an open-source infrastructure for user identity and risk management.
Compose verification processes for any vertical and geography using modular building blocks, components, and 3rd party integrations.

_____
	
### Why Open Source KYC/KYB & Risk stack?

Our mission is to allow any company to manage user identity and risk in a way that suits them and their unique changing needs, and be a part of a community which builds solutions together.
Main Open Source benefits:
*  **Future proof** - modular and extendable building blocks.
*  **Global** - Multiple vendors accessible in one UI and case management dashboard.
*  **White label** - Customizable UX and UI.
*  **Community** - Use what others have built, contribute yourself, leverage community maintainance.

### What can you find in this project?
 * KYC/KYB flows and UI in Mobile and web SDKs for user data and document collection - :white_check_mark: Available & Open Source! - [view details](https://github.com/ballerine-io/ballerine-web-ui/blob/staging/README.md#web-sdk)
 * Case management dashboard for users approval/rejection - ðŸŽ‰ Final stages of Open Sourcing!
 * Identity & risk vendors orchestration - :hourglass_flowing_sand: Almost done
 * No-code rule engine to control Frontend and backend flows - :construction: WIP

# Web SDK Flows

### Description
Web SDK Flows can generate custom made, branded flows to collect KYC/KYB documents and user information.
The SDK UI is embeddable inside exsiting apps or deployed as an webapp.

<img src="https://blrn-staging-assets.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/phones.png">

**Why you should use Ballerine's flows:**
* Pre-made KYC/KYB templates.
* Customizable UI and flow to fit your desired experience and brand.
* Ability to use different vendors in the backend over the same flow with.
* Multi platform support (Desktop, mobile web, mobile native).
* All camera and different devices edge cases covered and tested.
* Small and fast, built with Svelte (less than 50kb gzipped).

		BallerineSDK.flows.mount('flow-host-element', 'my-kyc-flow', {});
	});	
}
</script>
```

#### Native Mobile apps

The approch to native apps are all the native funcationalties happens inside Ballerine native sdks (Android, iOS) while and the represenation layer is still an web app (inside a native webview).

This way we can enjoy both worlds:
* Web UI: Flexable UI that can be changes instantly from the server (no app deployments or store submissions). 
* Native API's: Native camera, deep behavioral analysis, ekyc and more..

See Android and iOS repositories for guidance:

[Android SDK](https://github.com/ballerine-io/ballerine-android-sdk) | [iOS SDK](https://github.com/ballerine-io/ballerine-ios-sdk)

* Create workflows operators can trigger from the interface.
* Optimize manual work by customizing the layouts and information presented.
* Use as standalone tool or embed in your existing dashboard.

# Workflow builder & Rule engine (WIP)


### Description
Customize your identity and risk workflows in code or with a low-code platform non-tchnical staff can play with.

* Test out different vendor to optmize convertion and costs.
* Utilize data sources and tools contributed by Ballerine or the community.
* Visualize complex flows to provide observability of how things work to the rest of the company.

# High-Level Architecture

Ballerine's architecture is flexible and composable.

**Components**

Components are independent and reusable frontend or backend pieces of configuration, code, or connectors.
Each component can be plugged into the infrastructure and used by the underlying building blocks.

**Apps** 

Apps bundle are a set of components and connectors that serve a specific use case (like KYC/KYB).
	
**Connectors** 

Connectors are integrations to 3rd party vendors. They can be generated with an OpenAPI spec automatically or be built following a predefined interface.
